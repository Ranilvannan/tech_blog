GNOME Commander

GNOME Commander is a fast and powerful graphical filemanager for the GNOME desktop environment, it has a "two-pane"
interface in the tradition of Norton and Midnight Commander. GNOME Commander is file manager aimed at people who
want a fast and efficient file manager. GNOME Commander can currently perform most common file operations, and will
detect changes to files caused by other programs and update its views without the need for the user to manually
reload. The program also supports Copy and Paste, DND and MIME. It aims to fulfill the demands of more advanced users
who like to focus on file management, their work through special applications and running smart commands.

The Gnome Commander is one of the file managers with two separate panels, based on the split-view interface of
Norton Commander. This allows the simultaneous view of a source and destination directory for copying and moving
files or directories. This also makes comparing directories very convenient. The number of windows on the desktop is
thereby reduced. In Gnome Commander the two panels can be arranged either horizontally or vertically.
