Thunar File Manager

Thunar is a modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Thunar has been designed from the ground up to be
fast and easy to use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive and does not include any confusing or useless options
by default. Thunar starts up quickly and navigating through files and folders is fast and responsive. Thunar is a
file manager for Linux and other Unix-like systems, initially written using the GTK+ 2 toolkit and later
ported to the GTK+ 3 toolkit.

Thunar is designed to start up faster and be more responsive than some other Linux file managers, such as
Nautilus and Konqueror. Thunar is simple and lightweight by design, but its functionality can be extended
through plugins. Thunar supports automatic mounting and unmounting of removable media is an added advantages makes
easy handling of removable items.

File Manager Window:

The file manager window consists of a Side Pane on the left, the Main Area on the right and a Location
Selector above the main area.

Side Pane:

The Side Pane is organized into three categories of objects: Devices, Places and Network.

In the Devices section, you will find fixed disk partitions as well as removable media listed. At a minimum,
on a simple system with a single disk and operating system, you will just see the File System listed. Clicking on
this item will take you to the root of your file system and display the entire folder hierarchy. If you are new to
Linux, this structure may be confusing. You can learn more about it in The UNIX File System section.

The Places section provides a location for storing shortcuts to the various file folders on your system. The three
shortcuts shown in the figure above are there by default and they can not be removed or rearranged. The first
shortcut will lead to your Home Folder, the folder where you store all your personal data, and will therefore have
the name of the current user.

In the Network section, you will see a single Browse Network icon. Clicking this icon will allow you to connect
to a server or network share to browse and view files on that server. The file manager will find any computers
on your local area network that advertise their ability to serve files.

Main Area:

The Main Area will always display the contents of the current folder. Double-click on folders to enter them and
right-click on files or folders to bring up a context menu offering additional options for them. Select multiple
files or folders by using the standard Shift-click or Ctrl-click method (for contiguous and non-contiguous items
respectively). An alternate method for selecting contiguous items is to drag a rectangle over them with the mouse.

Location Selector:

The Location Selector shows the path to the current folder starting from the root directory (or the URL in the case
of a network share). The path can be displayed in either a Pathbar or Toolbar style by clicking View â†’ Location
Selector from the menu.
