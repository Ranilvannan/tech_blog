SpaceFM:

SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file and desktop manager for Linux with built-in VFS, udev- or HAL-based device
manager, customisable menu system, and bash-GTK integration. SpaceFM aims to provide a stable, capable file manager
with significant customisation capabilities. SpaceFM is a fork of the legacy PCMan File Manager.  It is a lightweight,
highly configurable, desktop-independent file manager.

PCManFM-Mod was later used as a base for developing SpaceFM, which included an extensible user interface, multiple
panel support, a new udev device manager, inotify support, and removed dependencies on fam/gamin and HAL. Much of
the internal virtual filesystem (VFS), which had been developed and debugged in legacy PCManFM and PCManFM-Mod, was
retained and extended, providing SpaceFM with a reliable VFS to build upon.
