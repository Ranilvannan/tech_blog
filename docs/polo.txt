Polo File manager

Polo is an Advanced file manager for the Linux desktop, which offers a number of features that you'll find in similar
tools of it's kind, and some features you would not. Polo is a file manager that shows a great deal of promise,
it could easily wind up as a default file manager on many a distribution. The one thing holding Polo back is its
beta status and the lack of recent updates.

It comes with multiple panes with multiple tabs in each pane, support
for archive creation, extraction and browsing, support for cloud storage, support for running KVM images, support
for modifying PDF documents and image files, support for writing ISO files to UDB drives and much more.
