Nautilus File manager

GNOME Files, formerly and internally known as Nautilus, is the official file manager for the GNOME desktop.
Nautilus is a GUI-based file manager that provides a simple and integrated way to manage your files and applications.
Nautilus is always running while you are using GNOME. The file manager lets you organize your files into folders.
Folders can contain files and may also contain other folders. Using folders can help you find your files more easily.

GNOME Files relies on a file system abstraction layer (provided by GVfs) to browse local and remote file systems,
including but not limited to FTP sites, Windows SMB shares, OBEX protocol (often implemented on cellphones),
files transferred over shell protocol, HTTP and WebDAV and SFTP servers. Nautilus can display previews of files
in their icons, be they text files, images, sound or video files via thumbnailers such as Totem. Audio files are
previewed (played back over GStreamer) when the pointer is hovering over them.

Nautilus File manager modes:

Spatial mode is the default in GNOME, but your distributor, vendor, or system administrator may have configured
Nautilus to use browser mode by default.

Browser mode: browse your files and folders
The file manager window represents a browser, which can display any location. Opening a folder updates the current
file manager window to show the contents of the new folder.

Spatial mode: navigate your files and folders as objects
The file manager window represents a particular folder. Opening a folder opens the new window for that folder.
Each time you open a particular folder, you will find its window displayed in the same place on the screen and the same size as the last time you viewed it (this is the reason for the name 'spatial mode').

Managing Your Files and Folders:

The file manager includes views that enable you to show the contents of your folders in different ways,
icon view, and list view.

Icon View: Shows the items in the folder as icons.
List view: Shows the items in the folder as a list.
